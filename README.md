# Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

This repository contains a complete machine learning pipeline to analyze and predict diabetes risk using health indicators from a structured dataset. The project applies various classification algorithms to identify key predictors and assess model performance, aiming to support early diagnosis and personalized intervention strategies.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objectives

- Identify significant health-related risk factors for diabetes.
- Build predictive models using machine learning techniques.
- Evaluate model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Visualize patterns and correlations in the data through EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Healthcare-Diabetes.csv (Kaggle public dataset)
- **Size**: 2768 records
- **Features**:
  - Id 
  - Pregnancies
  - Glucose
  - BloodPressure
  - SkinThickness
  - Insulin
  - BMI
  - DiabetesPedigreeFunction
  - Age
  - Outcome (0 = No Diabetes, 1 = Diabetes)

## ðŸ“… Data Exploration & Visualization

- No missing values across all features.
- Visualizations included:
  - **Histograms** and **box plots** for all numeric features
  - **Scatter plots** to analyze relationships (e.g., Glucose vs. BMI)
  - **Correlation heatmap** to explore variable associations
  - **Line graph** showing Glucose trends across IDs

### Key Observations:
- Glucose, BMI, and Age showed strong correlation with diabetes.
- Some features (e.g., SkinThickness, Insulin) had high variance and outliers.
- The dataset had a diabetes prevalence rate of ~34.4%.
